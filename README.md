# An audio visualizer I made just for fun!
Heard a song I liked and it inspired me to make a basic retro/future visualizer

TLDR; It takes sound and converts the sound into frequency data which was used to set the size of each bar. As the song plays on the container of bars updates, making the bars look like they're moving to the beat!
