# Audio Visualizer Project
Heard a song I liked and it inspired me to make a basic audio visualizer.

Only capable of processing the one song right now, but future plans are to let you upload any mp3 and have it work.

TLDR; It takes sound and converts the audio into frequency data which was then used to set the size of each bar. As the song plays on the container of bars updates, making the bars look like they're moving to the beat!
